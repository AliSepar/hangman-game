## Hangman

This is a practice project to learn more and improve my Javascript skills.

## The mission

You have to make a website version of the hangman word game. To do so try to think the structure, the backend (functionality) and the frontend (design) of your project before you start coding.

At the very least your version of the hangman should:

- propose an hidden word

- allow the selection of letters

- verify if a selected letter belongs to the word

- count the number of failure (lives)

- check if itâ€™s a game over

- check if the word as been found

Optionally it can:

- keep in memory all guessed letters

- only let the player guess a letter once

## Result:
